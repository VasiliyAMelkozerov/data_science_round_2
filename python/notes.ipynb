    "## Introduction\n",
    "This video by [Coding with Lewis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6x6oo1Zvhg) is an approachable video that goes over a general view of python. Typically python has been a language that is recommended to people who want to get into programming because of its easy to read syntax. The tabbed out spaces help keep the code easier to read and most of it can be read as plain english to keep it human friendly. More applicably here is that python is the most widely used language in the [Data Science](https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-science). "
